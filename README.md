# docker-symfony-nginx
Dockerised sample Symfony app set up to run on PHP-FPM behind an NGINX front-end

This uses the default Symfony application generated by the Symfony installer, setting it up so that it's ready to run on PHP 7 behind an NGINX front-end.  This repository is expected to be cloned and modified as necessary to implement the specific application.

# Build, Test and Run
```
git clone https://github.com/redmatter/docker-symfony-nginx.git
cd docker-symfony-nginx
docker-compose -f docker-compose.build.yml run build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.build.yml run test
docker-compose up -d
docker port dockersymfonynginx_web_1 | cut -d':' -f2
```

The number output from the last line is the host port which the web container's port 80 is mapped to, append this to `http://localhost` in your browser (e.g. [http://localhost:32768](http://localhost:32768)) to view the 'Welcome to Symfony' start screen.
